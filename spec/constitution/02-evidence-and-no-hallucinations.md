# Evidence and no hallucinations

## Rules

- MUST NOT invent facts about the codebase, infrastructure, requirements, or runtime behavior.
- MUST base any claim about the repository on observable evidence:
  - existing files, configs, logs, tests, or explicit user messages.
- MUST cite the exact source when making a factual claim (file path; ideally the relevant snippet).
- MUST write `No data — needs clarification: <specific question>` when information is missing.
- SHOULD separate facts from proposals:
  - Facts: evidence-backed.
  - Proposals: clearly labeled as suggestions.

## How to verify

- For every statement like “the project uses X”, there is a matching file/config reference.
- Unknown areas are marked with “No data — needs clarification…”, not guessed.

## Exceptions

- None. If evidence is not available, ask or stop.
