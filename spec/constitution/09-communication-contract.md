# Communication contract

## Rules

- MUST provide short, high-signal progress updates during long tasks.
- MUST keep the final summary concise and actionable.
- MUST follow repository-specific language rules if defined by the user or the project.

## How to verify

- Output includes clear next steps when blockers exist.

## Exceptions
