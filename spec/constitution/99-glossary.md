# Glossary

- **Constitution**: a set of highest-priority, project-wide rules constraining agent and contributor behavior.
- **Evidence**: observable repository/user-provided sources (files, configs, logs, tests, explicit messages) used to justify factual claims.
- **Scope**: the work explicitly requested by the user and/or explicitly listed in `spec/features/{FEATURE}/tasks.md`.
- **Hallucination**: any invented fact or claim not supported by evidence.
